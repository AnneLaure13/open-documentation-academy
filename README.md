# Open Documentation Academy

*An open source on-ramp through documentation*

The Open Documentation Academy combines Canonical’s documentation team with documentation newcomers, experts, and those in-between, to help us all improve documentation practice and become better writers. Fill blanks in your resume and paint your GitHub activity tracker golden.

If you're a newcomer, we can provide help, advice, mentorship, and a hundred different tasks to get started on. If you're an expert, we want to create a place to share knowledge, a place to get involved with new developments, and somewhere you can ask for help on your own projects.

A key aim of this initiative is to help lower the barrier into successful open-source software contribution, by making documentation into the gateway.

## This repository

The purpose of this repository is to list and track global documentation tasks. These are filed as _issues_ in this repository. Tasks vary from broken formatting and missing documentation, to updates, re-structuring, and rewriting.

Issues are identified and shared by participating projects at Canonical who control whether an issue is merged into their documentation. An academy participant and a mentor work together to guide a contribution through to completion.

### Participating projects

The first words of an issue's title will typically indicate the project it involved. These include the following:

- [Canonical OpenStack](https://ubuntu.com/openstack/docs): our enterprise cloud platform 
- [Juju](https://juju.is/docs):  open source orchestration engine
- [Canonical Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes/docs): the reference platform for Kubernetes on all major public clouds
- [LXD](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/latest/): open source container and VM management at any scale
- [Launchpad](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/launchpad/en/latest/): software development lifecycle and collaboration platform
- [MAAS](https://maas.io/docs): bare metal cloud with on-demand servers
- [Our Sphinx and RST starter pack](https://github.com/canonical/sphinx-docs-starter-pack): our open source template for building modern documentation
- [Snap and Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/docs): Linux app packages and the build tools for desktop, cloud and IoT

This list will expand as more projects get involved. We're also happy to include projects outside of Canonical.

### Issue labels

We use one or more of the following issue labels both for consistency and to indicate what might be expected from a task.

#### diátaxis

Revise a document to better conform to a [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) type:

- Tutorial
- How-to
- Reference
- Explanation

This may require a document to be split, edited, or sometimes re-written.

#### edit

Edit pre-existing documentation for consistency, accuracy, style and application.

#### explanation

Create or revise a document to better reflect an understanding-oriented [explanation](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/).

#### good first issue

An ideal task to start with. Marking issues with this label is a widely adopted [GitHub convention](https://github.com/topics/good-first-issue).

#### help wanted

Another [GitHub convention](https://github.com/topics/help-wanted) to indicate that a project welcomes community help with an issue. 

#### how-to

Create or revise a document to better reflect a [how-to guide](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/) to achieve a specific goal.

#### new

Adding new or missing documentation for a specific tool, feature, or function.

#### oda-admin

Tasks relating to the admin of the Open Documentation Academy (ODA) project.

#### reference

Create or revise a document to better reflect a technical description to use as [reference](https://diataxis.fr/reference/) material.

#### review

Review pre-existing documentation for quality, accuracy and consistency. This work may require small updates to the original documentation and/or the creation of sub-tasks to address any detected and substantial shortcomings.

#### size 

This is our estimation of effort and complexity. Size values range from 1 to 8, representing _least effort_ to _most effort_ respectively. These numbers follow the [Fibonacci ### sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) sequence of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, with size 8 likely to be a significant undertaking.

#### tutorial

Develop, write, edit or update a [tutorial](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/). Tutorials are often the hardest kinds of documentation to write or update because they primarily require good teaching skills and perception, before you even start writing.

#### update

Update potentially outdated instructions, commands, or version numbers. These tasks might include release notes, version numbers, new command line arguments and features, and even complete overhauls when a major release occurs.
