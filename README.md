# Open Documentation Academy

The Open Documentation Academy combines Canonical’s documentation team with documentation newcomers, experts, and those in-between, to help us all improve documentation practice and become better writers.

If you're a newcomer, we can provide help, advice, mentorship, and a hundred different tasks to get started on. If you're an expert, we want to create a place to share knowledge, a place to get involved with new developments, and somewhere you can ask for help on your own projects.

A key aim of this initiative is to help lower the barrier into successful open-source software contribution, by making documentation into the gateway. 

## What you’ll get out of it

**Real experience, real skills, real discipline**: Open-source products in the Canonical/Ubuntu industry are highly-respected and used by millions of people. Standards for contributions are high. You’ll have a chance to contribute to prestigious projects, and acquire the skills to take part in the development of world-class software.

**Structured support**: The Open Documentation Academy will include a structured programme of support and development for serious participants, taking them from their first steps to having the confidence to lead their own documentation initiatives.

**Recognition**: Your contributions will speak for themselves, but we’ll vouch for you too. Participants who complete our programme will receive certification from Canonical.

## What we offer

**Mentoring**: You are not alone. Regardless of whether you're writing your first document, or editing your hundredth, we're here to help. Our 1:1 mentorship can help you through your first contributions, provide advice on approaches, and help you build your confidence.

**Guided contributions**: Help us identify gaps, nominate solutions, and propose documentation of your own. We curate tasks across a variety of different open source projects. Choose a task you're interested in, at a level you're comfortable with, and make a contribution. Research. Write. Commit. Fill blanks in your resume and colour your GitHub Activity tracker golden.

**Community**: Through our forum and communication channels, you can directly interact with documentation teams and co-conspirators across the globe. We want our community to be friendly, inclusive and always supremely approachable, in accordance with the Ubuntu Code of Conduct.

## This repository

The purpose of this repository is to list and track global documentation issues for the Academy. Issues vary from broken formatting and missing documentation, to updates, re-structuring, and rewriting.

Issues are identified and shared by participating projects at Canonical who control whether an issue is merged into their documentation. An academy participant and a mentor work together to guide a contribution through to completion.
