# Getting started as a contributor

This set of guides is intended for anyone who wants to contribute more substantial changes to documentation (or on a more regular basis) using the Ubuntu command line. 

For quick corrections to a page, it's perfectly fine to use the GitHub web interface instead! 

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this guide, you will need to set up [a GitHub account](https://github.com/), if you don't already have one.
The GitHub documentation is rather good, if you get stuck or need any explanation of particular topics.

## Getting your environment set up

Where you start in this series will depend on whether you're using a Windows machine, or an Ubuntu one. If you're using Windows, start on Part 1. If you are running Ubuntu, or have a dual-boot system where one of your options is Ubuntu, feel free to skip Part 1 and go straight to Part 2. 

1. [Getting started using Windows](start_with_WSL.md)
2. [Install and configure git](install_git.md)
3. [Working with git on the command line](using_git.md)

## Optional steps

1. [Set up Sphinx](setup_sphinx.md)
   This applies if you are working on a project that uses Sphinx to render the documentation.
1. [Command line cheat sheet](CLI_basics.md)
   This reference will help remind you of the basic commands needed to work with files on the command line.
