# SSL Certificates

**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates** are a component of creating a secure communication over the internet. They provide a process for encrypting and authenticating data sent between a client and a server. In the context of Landscape, being a server management tool, it uses SSL certificates to needs to communicate securely with its servers, reducing the chance of unauthorized access and data breaches.

If you install Landscape with a public IP, the [Quickstart installation](https://ubuntu.com/landscape/docs/quickstart-deployment) guide recommends you install an SSL certificate from a certificate authority, such as LetsEncrypt. The SSL certificate is used to secure the communication between the Landscape server and the clients (the servers being managed) as the data travels over public networks. This ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt and access it.  In other words, if someone were able to intercept the communication, they would not be able to understand the data being sent because it is encrypted.

> Think of Landscape as a post office and SSL certificates as special keys to mailboxes. Each managed server is like a mailbox. To send a secure message, the post office (Landscape) locks the message (data) with a special key (SSL certificate). Only the mailbox (managed server) with the matching key can open it. This is how Landscape communicates securely with servers using an SSL certificate.
